    STL   =       Containers          +          Algorithm             +          Iterators
            (Object which store data)   (procedure to process data)      (Objects to point an element in containers)

    Continaers are of three types:
    1. Sequence Containers  -->  Data stored in linear fashion eg Vector , List , Dequeue etc

    2. Associate Containers --> Designed in a way to acees the data faster or direct access  eg map , set , multimap. multiset etc

    3. Derived Containers --> Real world modeling or handeling  eg stack , queue , priority queue  etc


     When to use which?
     Sequence Containers
     1. Vector --> Random access of data is faster and middle insertion/deletion is slow but insertion usually fast at the end
